<p begin="00:00:08.10" dur="3500 ms" style="1">before we can reap the rewards.</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.23" dur="7400 ms" style="1">Money talks. If we choose to exempt this province from taxation,&lt;br /&gt;its people will soon forgive their new masters and public order</p>

<p begin="00:00:23.20" dur="7200 ms" style="1">A strong military presence can also help matters. If we&lt;br /&gt;recruit some further units and leave them garrisoned here, </p>
<p begin="00:00:30.40" dur="3900 ms" style="1">they will help stamp out protests and stave off rebellions.</p>
