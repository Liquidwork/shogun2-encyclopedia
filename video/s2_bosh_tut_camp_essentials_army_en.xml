<p begin="00:00:08.09" dur="7992 ms" style="1">An army is made up of individual units of troops&lt;br /&gt;that we recruit. They cost money to build and maintain,</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.08" dur="4500 ms" style="1">so we need to keep them busy to justify their upkeep.</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.27" dur="9063 ms" style="1">Let's add some more units to our army.&lt;br /&gt;We can recruit and reinforce armies from any of our cities. </p>
<p begin="00:00:30.33" dur="8763 ms" style="1">The buildings present in a city decide the type and&lt;br /&gt;quality of units available and can include cavalry, artillery and infantry.</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.09" dur="8700 ms" style="1">Left-clicking a unit type, adds it to our recruitment queue.&lt;br /&gt;It may take a number of turns before the unit becomes available.</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.56" dur="8633 ms" style="1">Let's mobilise our new recruits. By holding shift we can&lt;br /&gt;select our units by using left-click, then we can</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.19" dur="7400 ms" style="1">right-click outside of the city to form a new army.</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.22" dur="8316 ms" style="1">Without a General in charge, this army will lack leadership&lt;br /&gt;and organisation. Let's merge them with our existing army</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.54" dur="4300 ms" style="1">and bring them under the command of its General.</p>
