<div class="textblock">
<h3 id="enc_text_manual_agent_actions_subterfuge_spying">Passive Spying (Shogun 2)</h3>
<p>Every army, fleet, or agent can reveal information about rival armies, fleets and settlements in their immediate proximity or within their line of sight. The level of detail revealed depends on the type of character who is spying, so, for instance, <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/044_enc_manual_agents_subterfuge.html#enc_text_manual_agents_subterfuge_ninja">ninja</a> are able to reveal far more information than <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/045_enc_manual_agents_religious.html#enc_text_manual_agents_religious_monks">monks</a> or <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/045_enc_manual_agents_religious.html#enc_text_manual_agents_religious_missionaries">missionaries</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="textblock">
<h3 id="enc_text_manual_agent_actions_subterfuge_assassination">Assassination</h3>
<p><a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/044_enc_manual_agents_subterfuge.html#enc_text_manual_agents_subterfuge_ninja">Ninja</a> and <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/044_enc_manual_agents_subterfuge.html#enc_text_manual_agents_subterfuge_geisha">geisha</a> in Shogun 2, monomi in Rise of the Samurai and <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/044_enc_manual_agents_subterfuge.html#enc_text_manual_agents_subterfuge_boshin_shinobi">shinobi</a>, <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/044_enc_manual_agents_subterfuge.html#enc_text_manual_agents_subterfuge_boshin_ shinsengumi ">shinsengumi</a> and <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/044_enc_manual_agents_subterfuge.html#enc_text_manual_agents_subterfuge_boshin_ishin_shishi">ishin shishi</a> in Fall of the Samurai are able to <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/044a_enc_manual_agent_actions_subterfuge.html#enc_text_manual_agent_actions_subterfuge_assassination">assassinate</a> generals and rival agents. Simply select your agent and right-click on your chosen target. If using a ninja, select assassination from the options presented to you. A panel will appear stating the chances of success. If you decide to go ahead with the mission your agent will pursue the target and attempt to kill them. However, bear in mind that there is a chance of capture or execution - as is the case in all espionage situations.</p>
</div>
<div class="textblock">
<h3 id="enc_text_manual_agent_actions_subterfuge_spy_network_ninja">Spy Network</h3>
<p>Placing a <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/044_enc_manual_agents_subterfuge.html#enc_text_manual_agents_subterfuge_ninja">ninja</a> in Shogun 2, a <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/044_enc_manual_agents_subterfuge.html#enc_text_manual_agents_subterfuge_monomi">monomi</a> in Rise of the Samurai or a <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/044_enc_manual_agents_subterfuge.html#enc_text_manual_agents_subterfuge_boshin_shinobi">shinobi</a> in Fall of the Samurai inside one of your castle towns or settlements (in Fall of the Samurai) will enable him to set up a spy network there. This not only increases line of sight from the province, it also makes it easier to detect hidden agents and armies, and decreases the chance that <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/045_enc_manual_agents_religious.html#enc_text_manual_agents_religious_monks">monks</a> or <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/045_enc_manual_agents_religious.html#enc_text_manual_agents_religious_missionaries">missionaries</a> will be successful when encouraging a revolt.</p>
</div>
<div class="textblock">
<h3 id="enc_text_manual_agent_actions_subterfuge_sabotage">Sabotage</h3>
<p><a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/044_enc_manual_agents_subterfuge.html#enc_text_manual_agents_subterfuge_ninja">Ninja</a> in Shogun 2, monomi in Rise of the Samurai or <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/044_enc_manual_agents_subterfuge.html#enc_text_manual_agents_subterfuge_boshin_shinobi">shinobi</a> in Fall of the Samurai are able to damage enemy buildings through acts of sabotage. Simply select your agent, right-click on a settlement and select sabotage from the options presented to you. If your target is a castle town, a panel will appear showing a list of buildings and the chances of success. If you decide to go ahead with the mission select a building - your ninja will then move there and attempt to damage it upon his arrival. However, bear in mind that there is a chance of detection, capture or execution - as is the case in all espionage situations.</p>
</div>
<div class="textblock">
<h3 id="enc_text_manual_agent_actions_subterfuge_sabotage_army">Army Sabotage</h3>
<p><a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/044_enc_manual_agents_subterfuge.html#enc_text_manual_agents_subterfuge_ninja">Ninja</a> in Shogun 2, monomi in Rise of the Samurai or <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/044_enc_manual_agents_subterfuge.html#enc_text_manual_agents_subterfuge_boshin_shinobi">shinobi</a> in Fall of the Samurai are able to sabotage rival armies, affecting their ability to move during a turn and causing casualties as he subtly poisons their food and water supply. Simply select your agent, right-click on an army and select army sabotage from the options presented to you. A panel will appear stating the chances of success. If you decide to go ahead with the mission your ninja will pursue the target and attempt to undermine their movements. However, bear in mind that there is a chance of detection, capture or execution - as is the case in all espionage situations.</p>
</div>
<div class="textblock">
<h3 id="enc_text_manual_agent_actions_subterfuge_bribery">Bribery</h3>
<p><a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/044_enc_manual_agents_subterfuge.html#enc_text_manual_agents_subterfuge_metsuke">Metsuke</a> in Shogun 2 or junsatushi in Rise of the Samurai are able to bribe rival generals, their armies and the garrisons of castle towns to switch allegiances to support your own <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/002b_enc_glossary.html#enc_glossary_clan">clan</a>. Simply select your metsuke, right-click on the target army or garrison and select bribery from the options presented to you. A panel will appear stating the chances of success. If you decide to go ahead with the mission your metsuke will pursue the target and attempt to bribe them. A general who has been successfully bribed will form a new army with those troops who have decided to follow him (which may not be all of them) and begin moving towards your territory. He will also lose <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/025_enc_manual_clan_loyalty.html">loyalty</a>, as befits one who will betray his own so easily. If one of your generals is bribed, his family will be expelled from your clan and will disappear from the <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/016_enc_manual_hud_management.html#enc_text_manual_hud_management_family">family tree</a>. Bribery of a garrison has to be completely successful for its province to change allegiance, otherwise the bribed units will leave the castle town and begin moving towards your territory in the same way as units from an army bribed in the field. Where a castle town does not have a garrison, a successful bribe will cause the entire province to change allegiance to your clan. To bribe, simply select your metsuke, right-click on your chosen target and select bribe from the options presented to you.</p>
</div>
<div class="textblock">
<h3 id="enc_text_manual_agent_actions_subterfuge_overseeing">Overseeing</h3>
<p>In Shogun 2 the presence of <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/044_enc_manual_agents_subterfuge.html#enc_text_manual_agents_subterfuge_metsuke">metsuke</a> within an army or castle town will increase the chances of detecting enemy <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/044_enc_manual_agents_subterfuge.html#enc_text_manual_agents_subterfuge_ninja">ninja</a> and reduce the chances that they will succeed in their dishonourable tasks. Metsuke also increase <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/020_enc_manual_public_order.html#enc_text_manual_public_order_repression">repression</a> and tax income when in castle towns, and <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/025_enc_manual_clan_loyalty.html">loyalty</a> when inside armies.</p>
</div>
<div class="textblock">
<h3 id="enc_text_manual_agent_actions_subterfuge_detection">Detection</h3>
<p>In Shogun 2 just having <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/044_enc_manual_agents_subterfuge.html#enc_text_manual_agents_subterfuge_metsuke">metsuke</a> present somewhere in your territory will increase the chances that enemy <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/044_enc_manual_agents_subterfuge.html#enc_text_manual_agents_subterfuge_ninja">ninja</a> will be detected.</p>
</div>
<div class="textblock">
<h3 id="enc_text_manual_agent_actions_subterfuge_trial">Apprehending Agents</h3>
<p>In Shogun 2 <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/044_enc_manual_agents_subterfuge.html#enc_text_manual_agents_subterfuge_metsuke">metsuke</a> can be ordered to hunt down and apprehend enemy agents. Although there is a chance the perpetrator will be executed, it is more likely they will be imprisoned and then returned to their clan capital at a later time. <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/045_enc_manual_agents_religious.html#enc_text_manual_agents_religious_monks">Monks</a>, <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/045_enc_manual_agents_religious.html#enc_text_manual_agents_religious_missionaries">missionaries</a> and indeed other metsuke are much harder to apprehend than other agents. To apprehend a character simply select your metsuke, right-click on your target agent and select "apprehend" from the options presented to you.</p>
</div>
<div class="textblock">
<h3 id="enc_text_manual_agent_actions_subterfuge_seduction">Seduction</h3>
<p><a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/044_enc_manual_agents_subterfuge.html#enc_text_manual_agents_subterfuge_shirabyoshi">Shirabyoshi</a> in Rise of the Samurai or <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/044_enc_manual_agents_subterfuge.html#enc_text_manual_agents_subterfuge_boshin_geisha">geisha</a> in Fall of the Samurai are able to convince rival agents (except other shirabyoshi or geisha) or general with wavering loyalty to join their family or clan. To seduce, simply select your shirabyoshi, right-click on your target agent and select seduction from the options presented to you. However, bear in mind that there is a chance that your agent may be caught and executed should she fail.</p>
</div>
<div class="textblock">
<h3 id="enc_text_manual_agent_actions_subterfuge_distraction">Distraction</h3>
<p><a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/044_enc_manual_agents_subterfuge.html#enc_text_manual_agents_subterfuge_gempei_dancer">Shirabyoshi</a> in Rise of the Samurai or <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/044_enc_manual_agents_subterfuge.html#enc_text_manual_agents_subterfuge_boshin_geisha">geisha</a> in Fall of the Samurai are able to distract rival armies, stopping them in their tracks. Simply select your shirabyoshi, right-click on an army and select distract from the options presented to you. A panel will appear stating the chances of success. If you decide to go ahead with the mission your shirabyoshi will pursue the target and attempt to hinder their movements. However, bear in mind that there is a chance of capture and execution.</p>
</div>
<div class="textblock">
<h3 id="enc_text_manual_agent_actions_subterfuge_request_allegiance">Request Allegiance</h3>
<p><a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/044_enc_manual_agents_subterfuge.html#enc_text_manual_agents_subterfuge_junsatsushi">Junsatsushi</a> (Rise of the Samurai), shinsengumi or ishin shishi (in Fall of the Samurai) are able to convince a differently-aligned population, and garrison, to pledge their allegiance to their cause. It is not possible to request allegiance in a province where your <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/012b_enc_manual_hud_events_victory.html#enc_text_manual_hud_events_victory_gempei_influence">influence</a> is less than 50%. To request allegiance, simply select your junsatsushi, shinsengumi or ishin shishi, right-click on your target agent and select request allegiance from the options presented to you. However, bear in mind that there is a chance that your agent may be caught and executed should he fail. These agents will also passively spread influence in a province by their presence alone, thereby making it more likely that a subsequent request for allegiance will be successful.</p>
</div>
<div class="textblock">
<h3 id="enc_text_manual_agent_actions_subterfuge_payoff">Payoffs</h3>
<p>In Rise of the Samurai <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/044_enc_manual_agents_subterfuge.html#enc_text_manual_agents_subterfuge_junsatsushi">junsatsushi</a> can detect and pay off rival agents. In effect a personal bribe not to take any further part in the war, success will lead to their removal from the game. However, bear in mind that there is a chance that your agent may be caught and executed should he fail.</p>
</div>
<div class="textblock">
<h3 id="enc_text_manual_agent_actions_subterfuge_passive_spying">Passive Spying (Fall of the Samurai)</h3>
<p>Every army, fleet or agent can reveal information about rival armies, navies and cities in their immediate proximity or within their line of sight. The level of detail available depends on the type of character who is spying, so, for instance, <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/044_enc_manual_agents_subterfuge.html#enc_text_manual_agents_subterfuge_boshin_shinobi">shinobi</a> are able to reveal more than <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/044_enc_manual_agents_subterfuge.html#enc_text_manual_agents_subterfuge_boshin_foreign_veteran">foreign veterans</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="textblock">
<h3 id="enc_text_manual_agent_actions_subterfuge_harass">Harassment</h3>
<p>In Fall of the Samurai, harassment reduces an enemy army's morale and causes attrition. To harass an enemy force, simply select your <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/044_enc_manual_agents_subterfuge.html#enc_text_manual_agents_subterfuge_boshin_foreign_veteran">foreign veteran</a>, right-click on a target army and select harass from the options presented to you.</p>
</div>
<div class="textblock">
<h3 id="enc_text_manual_agent_actions_subterfuge_single_combat">Single Combat</h3>
<p>In Fall of the Samurai a <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/044_enc_manual_agents_subterfuge.html#enc_text_manual_agents_subterfuge_boshin_foreign_veteran">foreign veteran</a> can challenge any agent apart from a <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/044_enc_manual_agents_subterfuge.html#enc_text_manual_agents_subterfuge_boshin_geisha">geisha</a> to single combat. Simply select a veteran, right-click on a target agent and select single combat from the options presented to you. A duel will ensue, resulting in the wounding or death of the loser. Be warned, failing to kill an opponent you have challenged will result in diplomatic penalties against the clan.</p>
</div>
<div class="textblock">
<h3 id="enc_text_manual_agent_actions_subterfuge_enchant">Enchantment</h3>
<p>In Fall of the Samurai a <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/044_enc_manual_agents_subterfuge.html#enc_text_manual_agents_subterfuge_boshin_geisha">geisha</a> is able to use her beauty and guile to convince a rival agent (except another geisha) or general with wavering loyalty to join your cause. To enchant, simply select your geisha, right-click on a target agent and select enchant from the options presented to you. However, bear in mind that there is a chance that your agent may be caught and executed should she fail.</p>
</div>
<div class="textblock">
<h3 id="enc_text_manual_agent_actions_subterfuge_persuade">Persuade Troops</h3>
<p>In Fall of the Samurai ishin shishi can persuade a general or the garrison of a settlement to switch allegiance to our cause. If successful, there is a chance that one or more of his units will follow him, also changing sides. Persuading a neutral army anywhere is tantamount to a declaration of war against their clan. Following successful persuasion, an army on neutral or friendly territory will retreat to your territory unless you have a diplomatic agreement for military access in place. Simply select our ishin shishi and right-click on a target army to attempt persuasion.</p>
</div>
<div class="textblock">
<h3 id="enc_text_manual_agent_actions_sabotage_subdue_dissidents">Subdue Dissidents</h3>
<p>In Fall of the Samurai shinsengumi are able to subdue dissident elements of the population by increasing repression in a town. As allegiance to the Shogunate increases, there is less need for repression and therefore the effect will gradually diminish. Simply select a shinsengumi and right-click on a town to begin subduing the dissident population.</p>
</div>
<div class="textblock">
<h3 id="enc_text_manual_agent_actions_sabotage_coerce_troops">Coerce Troops</h3>
<p>In Fall of the Samurai shinsengumi can coerce a general or the garrison of a settlement to switch allegiance to your cause. If successful, there is a chance that one or more of his units will follow him, also changing sides. Coercing a neutral army anywhere is tantamount to a declaration of war against their clan. Following successful coercion, an army on neutral or friendly territory will retreat to your territory unless we have a diplomatic agreement for military access in place. Simply select our shinsengumi and right-click on a target army to attempt coercion.</p>
</div>
<div class="textblock">
<h3 id="enc_text_manual_agent_actions_sabotage_gates">Opening the Gates</h3>
<p>In readiness for a siege assault, a ninja in Shogun 2, a monomi in Rise of the Samurai or a <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/044_enc_manual_agents_subterfuge.html#enc_text_manual_agents_subterfuge_boshin_shinobi">shinobi</a> in Fall of the Samurai can infiltrate an enemy castle and sabotage the gates. If he is successful the gates will be open when you reach the battlefield.</p>
</div>
<div class="textblock">
<h3 id="enc_text_manual_agent_actions_subterfuge_incite_revolt">Incite Revolt (Fall of the Samurai)</h3>
<p>In Fall of the Samurai both shinsengumi and ishin shishi can incite revolts. Successful incitement of a population causes a rebellion to occur in the target province. The greater the support for the Shogunate or the Emperor, the more likely it is that incitement will be successful. Decide if the chance of success is worth the risk before confirming the order, as failure may mean capture and execution.</p>
