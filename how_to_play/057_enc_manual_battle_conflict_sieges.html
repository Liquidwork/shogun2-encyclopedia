<h3 id="enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_sieges">Besieging Castles</h3>
<p>During siege battles the combat revolves around control of the castle and its central keep. The <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/046_enc_manual_battle_deployment.html#enc_text_manual_battle_deployment_zones">deployment zone</a> of the attacker will be outside the walls, the defender's will be around the keep. The object is to reach the keep and stay there and/or <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/052_enc_manual_battle_conflict_morale.html#enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_modes_routing">rout</a> or destroy the enemy army. Once the attacker gets to the keep a countdown begins, during which they must retain control of the area. Of course, if the attacking forces manage to entirely rout them before that time they automatically win the battle.<p><p>Click <a href="../../encyclopedia/video/s2_bosh_tut_siege_introduction.html#s2_bosh_tut_battle_siege_01">here</a> to view a video tutorial about this subject.</p>

<div class="textblock">
<h3 id="enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_capture">Capture of Siege Weapons</h3>
<p>Following victory in a battle, and dependent on having an empty space for a unit in your army, there is a chance that the vanquished enemy's <a href="../../encyclopedia/units/art_fire_projecting_mangonels.html">siege weapons</a> will be captured by your men. If this occurs they will appear on the <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/032_enc_manual_ui_battle.html#enc_text_manual_ui_battle_post">post-battle statistics panel</a>. The crew will be replaced by your own men.</p>
</div>
<div class="textblock">
<h3 id="enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_sieges_defence">Defending a Siege</h3>
<p>When fighting a siege battle as the defender remember that the enemy will try to either sneak past your defences or rush them by force of arms. Use archers to kill approaching units and melee troops to kill those that get inside the castle compound! The enemy will try to wipe out all defenders, and if your men <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/052_enc_manual_battle_conflict_morale.html#enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_modes_routing">rout</a> en masse from the castle the battle is over.</p>
</div>
<div class="textblock">
<h3 id="enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_sieges_units">Garrison Units (Shogun 2)</h3>
<p>When besieged by the enemy an existing garrison will be bolstered by specially spawned defence units, representing the retainers of the clan, which will automatically disappear again after the battle. Although defence units do not retain any experience they gain during a siege, they are fully replenished the next time they are called to fight. The number of units provided depends on the level of the castle. The types and number of units are as follows:<p><p>Fort: 1 unit of <a href="../../encyclopedia/units/inf_sword_samurai_retainers.html">samurai retainers</a><p>Stronghold: 1 unit of samurai retainers; 1 unit of <a href="../../encyclopedia/units/inf_spear_yari_ashigaru_citizenry.html">yari ashigaru garrison</a><p>Fortress: 1 unit of samurai retainers; 2 units of yari ashigaru garrison; 1 unit of <a href="../../encyclopedia/units/inf_missile_bow_ashigaru_citizenry.html">bow ashigaru garrison</a><p>Castle: 2 units of samurai retainers; 2 units of yari ashigaru garrison; 2 units of bow ashigaru garrison; 1 unit of <a href="../../encyclopedia/units/inf_heavy_onna_bushi.html">onna bushi</a><p>Citadel: 3 units of samurai retainers; 3 units of yari ashigaru garrison; 4 units of bow ashigaru garrison; 1 unit of onna bushi<p><p>These numbers are modified by the presence of certain legendary buildings and the number of units already present in a  garrison when a siege begins (up to a maximum of 20), so if you are entitled to 12 defence units, but have an existing garrison of 10 units, 10 defence units are provided. When a legendary building is present it provides one additional defence unit (which takes the place of the weakest one provided by the castle if the size of the defence force is limited by the size of the existing garrison). The types and number of units are as follows:<p><p>Legendary bajutsu school: 1 unit of <a href="../../encyclopedia/units/cav_spear_yari_cavalry.html">yari cavalry</a><p>Legendary kyudo school: 1 unit of <a href="../../encyclopedia/units/inf_missile_bow_samurai.html">bow samurai</a><p>Legendary sojutsu school: 1 unit of <a href="../../encyclopedia/units/inf_spear_yari_samurai.html">yari samurai</a><p>Legendary kenjutsu school: 1 unit of <a href="../../encyclopedia/units/inf_sword_katana_samurai.html">katana samurai</a><p><p>In addition, there are slightly different rules for the Ikko Ikki, whose buildings provide naginata warrior monks as defence units, who will automatically replace the weakest defence unit(s) provided by the castle. The types and numbers of units are as follows:<p><p>Jodo shinshu temple: 1 unit of <a href="../../encyclopedia/units/inf_heavy_naginata_warrior_monks_citizenry.html">Ikko Ikki naginata warrior monks garrison</a><p>Jodo shinshu monastery: 2 units of Ikko Ikki naginata warrior monk garrison<p>Jodo shinshu sanctuary: 3 units of Ikko Ikki naginata warrior monk garrison<p>Honganji: 4 units of Ikko Ikki naginata warrior monk garrison</p>

<h3 id="enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_towers">Upgradable Tower Defences</h3>
<p>In Fall of the Samurai it is possible to increase the defensive capabilities of a castle by upgrading its tower defences. In battle, towers fire automatically and do not require the presence of a <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/057_enc_manual_battle_conflict_sieges.html#enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_sieges_units_boshin">garrison</a>, but can also be selected and controlled as if they were a unit. They can also be captured and turned against their owners or destroyed to render them useless to either side. Each <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/057_enc_manual_battle_conflict_sieges.html#enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_towers">tower upgrade</a> improves the <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/bosh_enc_ammo_types.html">ordnance</a> used; each <a href="../../encyclopedia/buildings/bos_castle_3_fortress.html">castle upgrade</a> improves the tower structure itself. The possible towers are as follows:<p><p>Archer Towers<p><p>Archer towers come as the default tower defences with all levels of castle, acting as an in-built defence against a besieging enemy. Occupied by archers, they automatically shoot arrows at any nearby foe. However, as the commander you can select them and order attacks on specific targets. In addition, archer towers have the <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/060i_enc_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_arrow_land.html#enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_arrow_land">fire arrow ability</a>, triggered via the dedicated button on the <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/047_enc_manual_battle_conflict.html#enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_review">battle review panel</a>.<p><p>Matchlock Towers<p><p>Matchlock towers act as an in-built defence against a besieging enemy. Occupied by matchlock-armed troops, they automatically fire bullets at any nearby foe. However, as the commander you can select them and order attacks on specific targets. In addition, matchlock towers have the <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/060u_enc_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_volley.html">rapid volley ability</a>, triggered via the dedicated button on the battle review panel.<p><p>Gatling Gun Towers<p><p>Gatling gun towers act as an in-built defence against a besieging enemy. Occupied by Gatling gun crews, they automatically fire bullets at high speed at any nearby foe. However, as the commander you can select them and order attacks on specific targets. In addition, Gatling gun towers have the <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/bosh_enc_abilities_firing_speed.html">increased firing speed ability</a>, triggered via the dedicated button on the battle review panel.<p><p>Battery Towers<p><p>Battery towers act as an in-built defence against a besieging enemy. Occupied by gun-armed troops, they are unique in that they can switch between two firing methods. The former being Gatling guns (firing bullets at high speed) or, alternatively, gun batteries (which fire cannon balls at any nearby foe). As the commander, you can select them and order attacks on specific targets. In addition, battery towers have the <a href="../../encyclopedia/how_to_play/bosh_enc_abilities_fast_reload.html#enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_abilities_fast_reload">fast reload ability</a>, triggered via the dedicated button on the battle review panel.<p><p>Click <a href="../../encyclopedia/video/s2_bosh_tut_siege_assault.html#s2_bosh_tut_battle_siege_11">here</a> to view a video tutorial about this subject.</p>

<div class="textblock">
<h3 id="enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_towers_3rd">Third Person Mode</h3>
<p>You can go in to third person mode at any time by pressing the H key. This allows you to control any artillery piece, including the Gatling gun and tower defences, with greater accuracy. This does come at the cost of controlling the rest of your army, so unless used carefully you can as easily lose a battle as win it.</p>
</div>
<div class="textblock">
<h3 id="enc_text_manual_battle_conflict_port_battles">Port Battles</h3>
<p>In Fall of the Samurai, if a port is attacked whilst ships are docked there, a siege battle must be fought for control of it. To achieve victory when attacking you must completely destroy the defending fleet or pound the port until it is reduced to rubble. If there are coastal defences in place the defending force will be bolstered by fire from gun batteries, which will act as fixed artillery whilst the battle is occurring. They will automatically select targets when set to fire-at-will, but you can also select and target the guns yourself if you wish.</p>
