<p>Castle Chain</p>
<p>The castle is the heart of the population and public order's main controlling factor. Each level of castle building increases the size of its castle town: providing an additional slot on which to build, enabling the recruitment of basic ashigaru units and determining how many units can be recruited there in each turn. Larger castles are more difficult to assault and spawn a larger defence force of samurai retainers and women. They are also the chief consumer of food in a province, so if farm building levels are not in step with castle size there will be food shortages.</p>
